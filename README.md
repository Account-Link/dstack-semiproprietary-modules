# Semi-Proprietary Modules for DStack

A novel approach to encrypted module distribution with self-containment verification.

## Concept

**Semi-proprietary modules** extend the classic "contingent payment" ZK proof pattern:

1. **Authors** encrypt modules and publish to public bulletin board
2. **Enclaves** decrypt according to on-chain policy (no author needed)
3. **Codesigned verifier** proves modules are truly self-contained
4. **No cheating** with external hints or pre-computed solutions

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Publish a module to bulletin board
node tools/publish-module.js private_module/sudoku-solver-selfcontained.js sudoku-solver-v1

# Test the system
node test/test-semiprop-system.js

# Run enclave service
node enclave/semiprop-service.js
```

## Directory Structure

- `private_module/` - Author's private solver code
- `enclave/` - TEE code (verifier + service + encryption)
- `tools/` - Publishing utilities
- `test/` - System verification tests
- `bulletin_board/` - Public encrypted module storage

## Docker

```bash
# Run complete system
docker-compose up

# Run with tools
docker-compose --profile tools up
```

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - Core functionality working, ready for DStack deployment

- âœ… Module encryption/decryption
- âœ… Self-containment verification
- âœ… Policy-based access control
- âœ… Bulletin board storage
- âœ… DStack TEE integration (JavaScript SDK)
- âœ… DStack deployment configuration
- ðŸš§ Real blockchain bulletin board


## Security Considerations

### TEE Security

- Modules encrypted with TEE-derived keys
- Attestation proves enclave integrity
- Hardware isolation prevents key extraction
- Signature chains prove authorization

### Policy Enforcement

- Payment policies enforced via attestation
- Time-based expiration checked cryptographically
- Self-containment verified via codesigned analysis
- No external dependencies allowed in modules

### Audit Trail

- All key derivations logged with paths
- Module access attempts tracked
- Policy violations recorded
- Signature chains provide proof of legitimacy
